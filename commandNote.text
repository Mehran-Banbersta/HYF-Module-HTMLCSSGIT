How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
 
mkdir .hiddenfolder

How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?
mkdir -p c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun

with echo we can write a new text in terminal => echo 'my first message' >> filename
